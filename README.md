# Article Reader

An Android application that consumes a simple JSON, then transforms the information into readable articles with an image and a little description.

The JSON comes from this service: http://www.kogimobile.com/applicant-test/applicant%20test%20feed.json

### How to use it

When you open the app you can see different kind of articles, select the one you like and It'll redirect you to the original site of the article where you can read it complete.

The first article is big to emphasize the newest information published.

Once you read all the article you can navigate on internet inside the app if you want to search more information.

The app contains a special feature. In the settings option you can select *color mode*. This option will paint some articles in a different color.
